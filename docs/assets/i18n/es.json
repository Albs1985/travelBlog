Habían reservado en el hotel Don Juan con pensión completa, para no tener ni tan siquiera pensar dónde o el qué comer. El camino discurrió sin complicaciones. Unas 4-5h la mar de amenas, con parada a comer en una área de servicio (los peores 35€ gastados en comida, pensaron). A su llegada al hotel se dieron cuenta de que era imposible aparcar cerca, por lo que descargaron encima de la acera y el joven y apuesto padre se dirigió a dar una vuelta de reconocimiento, en busca de un hueco. Y así fue, en una rampa, de lado, pero, a priori, bien aparcado y sin problemas... Al final del viaje les esperaba una 'bonita' sorpresa.        ",
        "bloque1_parrafo2": "Los primeros días se dedicaron a analizar el terreno. Tampoco podían hacer mucho con una embarazada de 7 meses y un niño de 2-3 años. La playa, para su sorpresa era de piedras, cantos rodados que, aunque no corrían riesgos de cortes, sí les resultaba molesto. De hecho, estuvieron más en la piscina del hotel (a petición del pequeño Mateu) que en la playa. Unas cervezas en los chiringuitos del paseo era su mejor pasatiempo, mientras Mateu se entretenía jugando en las piedras.",
        "bloque1_parrafo3": "Al tercer día decidieron echarse al mar con la embarcación FondoCristal, una empresa que se dedica a hacer viajes para turistas de las calas del norte de Tossa. Así conocieron la cala Giverola, poca gente y día soleado (cabe recordar que a pesar de la época, venían lluvias para casi la mitad de los días), a pesar del macro hotel con toboganes acuáticos. Todos disfrutaron mucho del paseo, viendo las cuevas cercanas y otras calas. ",

Tras consultarlo con los expertos (la profe Murta de la guardería), se sumergieron en la aventura de quitarle el pañal a Mateu. Para ello, haciendo uso del chantaje como recurso, y le prometieron sorpresas cada vez que hiciera caca en el vater. El problema era que la mayor sorpresa la tenían en casa, y quedaba mucho para poder dársela. Esto les obligó a complacerle con otros artículos como una pelota de Rayo McQueen, un tractor para la playa... Los primeros días fueron un desastre, pipi y caca por todas partes, sin lavadora... Pero finalmente lo consiguió. Empezó a avisar para ir al baño. Surfeamos juntos esa ola.",

Aunque habían pagado la pensión completa, siempre sienta bien un cambio de aires. Total, la diferencia entre media pensión y completa eran 100€ para los 8 dias los 3 viajeros... Un regalo. ",

Sí, la rueda delantera derecha estaba literalmente en el suelo. Un gran contratiempo para estar a 400km y un domingo. Por suerte, su Citroën Berlingo lleva debajo una rueda de repuesto, que además, para mayor suerte, era de las buenas (y no de esas de 80km). Así, al llegar la grúa, cambiaron la rueda y, después de recoger al resto de la familia, iniciaron el camino de vuelta a casa. Esta vez, la parada a comer fue en un McDonald's, mucho mejor, y 17€, más que mejor. ",
