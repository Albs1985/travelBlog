Aunque resulta irónico decir concretamente y dar una franja tan imprecisa. Pero es que nuestros protagonistas tampoco recuerdan bien esa época... Han pasado ya muchos años y los recuerdos quedan difusos. Tampoco podría concretar un día, ni siquiera un año, en el que esta pareja se encontraron por primera vez. Probablemente fue Bernia, su amiga en común, quien hiciera las presentaciones (tampoco ella lo recuerda). Tenían unos 14 años ...",
        "bloque1_parrafo2": "Adolescentes con ganas de descubrir el mundo, un día organizaron una acampada a Sant Joan de Penyagolosa, una ermita cercana al pico donde se podía hacer acampada libre. Sin saber bien cómo, ese viaje fueron más de 25 muchachos y muchachas (para algunos su primera salida en solitario, sin el control parental). Una experiencia única, recomendable y diría que obligatoria para todo joven. Como iréis descubriendo a medida que avanzan estas líneas, el viajar es lo más satisfactorio que encuentra el joven Albert.",

Se tomaban un café, una cerveza, y hasta otro día. Y así fueron pasando los días, hasta que sin saber bien cómo, una noche acabaron juntos. Aunque no daré detalles, esa noche marcó un punto y aparte. Para Albert fue algo especial, después de tanto tiempo tratando de conquistar a Alba. Aunque él sabía que era una difícil misión: ella tenía novio. Y aunque ya se sabe que un novio a los 15 años no suele ser para toda la vida, tampoco Albert se sentía cómodo en esa situación.",
        "bloque2_parrafo2": "Así pues, aquella noche transcurrió sin más, acabando con una llamada del novio y acompañando a Alba a la estación de metro a por un taxi.",

Albert se quedo en Valencia donde empezó a estudiar informática. El tiempo y el espacio hizo su trabajo y se distanciaron. Finalmente perdieron la relación.",

Y así fue cómo poco a poco estos jovenes muchachos volvieron a entablar conversación. Habían pasado casi 20 años desde que tomaban cervezas y charlaban en la estación de metro de Godella. ",
        "bloque4_parrafo2": "La primera toma de contacto fue en el festival Iboga, en verano, cuando todavía se hacía en Cullera. Fue contacto rápido, sin apenas charlar, entre la borrachera y el baile, poco se dirigieron la palabra. Pero ellos ya habían entablado el contacto, que era la clave. ",
        "bloque4_parrafo3": "Un mes después, Albert fue a verla a su casa de Xirivella. Allí tomaron una cerveza mientras tocaban la guitarra, cantaban y se ponían al día. Hacía tanto tiempo... Parecía un regreso al pasado... La tarde fluyó como olas del mar amaneciendo delante del Sol. ",
        "bloque5_parrafo1": "Poco despues, Albert tuvo un accidente de moto, el primero en su vida, y tuvo que estar en reposo en casa, lo que le empujó a llamar a Alba para ver si le hacía una visita. Y así fue. No tardo en ir a verlo, para, igualmente, charlar y pasar el rato. Se estaba cociendo a fuego lento una relación que iba a durar toda la vida.",
        "bloque5_parrafo2": "Y así llego la noche clave, aquella en la que todo iba a echar a rodar, la noche del todo o nada. Albert y sus amigos se encontraban en la puerta del Inmortal, pub de heavy donde han crecido y donde todavía les quedaba algún cartucho que quemar. ",
        "bloque6_parrafo1": "Allí hizo aparición Alba, con un vestido verde bien ajustado y que bien hacía resaltar su figura. Albert sabía que esa noche iba a pasar, que era esa la noche. Y así se lo hizo saber a su amiga Carmina. Ya solo faltaba encontrar el momento. Y el momento vino dado, como si de una señal divina se tratase, mientras estaban ambos hablando en la barra del bar, las luces del local se apagaron, lo que indicaba que el local iba a cerrar, pero que Albert interpretó como que era su momento. Y se lanzó a besarla. Alba se quedó clavada como una estaca. Los nervios estaban a flor de piel. ",
        "bloque6_parrafo2": "Alba estaba atravesando el final de un largo camino sentimental, donde necesitaba organizar sus sentimientos. Y llego Albert para descolocarla de nuevo. Pero tras una larga conversación, un diálogo entre dos adultos ya (34 años tenían ambos), decidieron marcharse a casa juntos. Pasaron los días, semanas y en menos de unos meses esa relación se convirtió en un barco imposible de hundir, preparado para cualquier iceberg.",
        "tituloParte3": "Se acercaba la fecha",
        "bloque7_parrafo1": "Y así llego el día en que Albert, tras varias indirectas y directas de Alba, decidió pedirle en matrimonio a Alba. Para ello, tuvo primero que organizarlo todo. Hicieron un viaje en furgoneta (camperizada). Y ese viaje no podía empezar peor... Rotura de correa de distribución a la altura de Castellón y vuelta a empezar (vinieron a por ellos los iaios para traerlos a casa hasta que arreglaran la furgoneta en el Norauto de Castellón). No se dieron por vencidos, y volvieron a empezar el camino dos días después. Así llegaron a la zona de Pre-Pirineos, a Barruera, donde había un pequeño parking de caravanas y furgonetas camper. Allí hicieron la noche intermedia, para al día siguiente lanzarse hacia el refugio de Colomers, donde habían reservado un par de días. Albert había crecido en esas montañas de pequeño con sus padres, con excursiones de refugio en refugio (aunque el de Colomers lo habían re-hecho, ya que el antiguo estaba en muy malas condiciones). ",
        "bloque7_parrafo2": "No podía esperar más, a la mañana siguiente, Albert había comprado una botella de vino, la cual pensaba abrir para celebrar el futuro matrimonio. Y le propuso a Alba hacer una pequeña excursión hacia los lagos de la parte alta de la zona, que a pesar de ser agosto, todavía tenían algo de nieve. Al llegar a aquel precioso lugar, le pidió que cerrara los ojos y al abrirlos le enseño el anillo. Un anillo valorado en 2€, para que de forma simbólica, darselo en matrimonio (ya que el verdadero habría que hacerlo a medida y se iba a perder la sorpresa). Ya solo faltaba poner fecha y organizar la boda, lo que no iba a ser poca cosa... no sabían dónde se estaban metiendo... El viaje continuava por la Costa Brava, con visita obligada a Cadaques, y ruta por las playas de la zona. Corría el año 2018..."

Unas 4-5h la mar de amenas, con parada a comer en una área de servicio (los peores 35€ gastados en comida, pensaron). A su llegada al hotel se dieron cuenta de que era imposible aparcar cerca, por lo que descargaron encima de la acera y el joven y apuesto padre se dirigió a dar una vuelta de reconocimiento, en busca de un hueco. Y así fue, en una rampa, de lado, pero, a priori, bien aparcado y sin problemas... Al final del viaje les esperaba una 'bonita' sorpresa.        ",

De hecho, estuvieron más en la piscina del hotel (a petición del pequeño Mateu) que en la playa. Unas cervezas en los chiringuitos del paseo era su mejor pasatiempo, mientras Mateu se entretenía jugando en las piedras.",

Para ello, haciendo uso del chantaje como recurso, y le prometieron sorpresas cada vez que hiciera caca en el vater. El problema era que la mayor sorpresa la tenían en casa, y quedaba mucho para poder dársela. Esto les obligó a complacerle con otros artículos como una pelota de Rayo McQueen, un tractor para la playa... Los primeros días fueron un desastre, pipi y caca por todas partes, sin lavadora...

Por suerte, su Citroën Berlingo lleva debajo una rueda de repuesto, que además, para mayor suerte, era de las buenas (y no de esas de 80km).
