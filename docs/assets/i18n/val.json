Van fer un viatge en furgoneta (camperitzada). I aquest viatge no podia començar pitjor... Trencament de corretja de distribució a l'altura de Castelló i tornada a començar (van venir per ells els iaios per portar-los a casa fins que arreglessin la furgoneta al Norauto de Castelló). No es donaren per vençuts, i van tornar a començar el camí dos dies després. Així van arribar a la zona de Pre-Pirineus, a Barruera, on hi havia un xicotet pàrquing de caravanes i furgonetes camper. Allà van fer la nit intermèdia, per a l'endemà llançar-se cap al refugi de Colomers, on havien reservat un parell de dies. Albert havia crescut en aquelles muntanyes de xicotet amb els seus pares, amb excursions de refugi en refugi (el de Colomers ho havien refet, ja que l'antic estava en molt males condicions)." ,

I li va proposar a l'Alba fer una xicoteta excursió cap als llacs de la part alta de la zona, que malgrat ser agost, encara tenien un poc de neu. En arribar a aquell preciós lloc, li va demanar que tanqués els ulls i en obrir-los li va ensenyar l'anell. Un anell valorat en 2€, per a que de forma simbòlica, donar-ho en matrimoni (ja que el bò caldria fer-ho a mida i es perdria la sorpresa). Ja només faltava posar data i organitzar el casament, que no seria poca cosa... no sabien on s'estaven ficant... El viatge continuava per la Costa Brava, amb visita obligada a Cadaques, i ruta per les platges de la zona. Corria l'any 2018..."

En arribar a l'hotel es van adonar que era impossible aparcar a prop, per la qual cosa van descarregar sobre la vorera i el jove i ben parat pare es va dirigir a fer una volta de reconeixement, a la recerca d'un lloc per al cotxe.

De fet, van estar més a la piscina de l'hotel (a petició del xicotet Mateu) que a la platja.
