Havien reservat a l'hotel Don Juan amb pensió completa, per no tenir ni tan sols pensar on o què menjar. El camí va transcórrer sense complicacions. Unes 4-5h la mar d'amenes, amb parada a dinar a una àrea de servei (els pitjors 35€ gastats en menjar, van pensar). En arribar a l'hotel es van adonar que era impossible aparcar a prop, per la qual cosa van descarregar sobre la vorera i el jove i ben paret es va dirigir a fer una volta de reconeixement, a la recerca d'un buit. I així va ser, en una rampa, de costat, però, a priori, ben aparcat i sense problemes... Al final del viatge els esperava una 'bonica' sorpresa.",
        "bloque1_parrafo2": "Els primers dies es van dedicar a analitzar el terreny. Tampoc no podien fer gaire amb una embarassada de 7 mesos i un nen de 2-3 anys. La platja, per a la seua sorpresa era de pedres, còdols que, encara que no corrien riscos de talls, sí que els resultava molest. De fet, van estar més a la piscina de l'hotel (a petició del petit Mateu) que a la platja. Unes cerveses als xiringuitos del passeig era el seu millor passatemps, mentre Mateu s'entretenia jugant a les pedres.",
        "bloque1_parrafo3": "Al tercer dia van decidir fer fora el mar amb l'embarcació FondoCristal, una empresa que es dedica a fer viatges per a turistes de les cales del nord de Tossa. Així van conèixer la cala Giverola, poca gent i dia assolellat (cal recordar que malgrat l'època, venien pluges per gairebé la meitat dels dies), malgrat el macrohotel amb tobogans aquàtics. Tots van gaudir molt del passeig, veient les coves properes i altres cales.",

Per això, fent ús del xantatge com a recurs, i li van prometre sorpreses cada vegada que fes caca al vater. El problema era que la sorpresa més gran la tenien a casa, i quedava molt per poder-li donar-la. Això els va obligar a complaure'l amb altres articles com una pilota de Rayo McQueen, un tractor per a la platja... Els primers dies van ser un desastre, pipi i caca per tot arreu, sense rentadora... Però finalment ho va aconseguir. Va començar a avisar per anar al bany. Surfem junts aquesta onada.",

Per sort, el seu Citroën Berlingo porta a sota una roda de recanvi, que a més, per a més sort, era de les bones (i no d'aquelles de 80km). Així, en arribar la grua, van canviar la roda i, després de recollir la resta de la família, van iniciar el camí de tornada a casa.
