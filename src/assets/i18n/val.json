Trencament de corretja de distribució a l'altura de Castelló i tornada a començar (van venir per ells els iaios per portar-los a casa fins que arreglessin la furgoneta al Norauto de Castelló). No es donaren per vençuts, i van tornar a començar el camí dos dies després. Així van arribar a la zona de Pre-Pirineus, a Barruera, on hi havia un xicotet pàrquing de caravanes i furgonetes camper. Allà van fer la nit intermèdia, per a l'endemà llançar-se cap al refugi de Colomers, on havien reservat un parell de dies.

En arribar a aquell preciós lloc, li va demanar que tanqués els ulls i en obrir-los li va ensenyar l'anell. Un anell valorat en 2€, per a que de forma simbòlica, donar-ho en matrimoni (ja que el bò caldria fer-ho a mida i es perdria la sorpresa).

En arribar a l'hotel es van adonar que era impossible aparcar a prop, per la qual cosa van descarregar sobre la vorera i el jove i ben parat pare es va dirigir a fer una volta de reconeixement, a la recerca d'un lloc per al cotxe.

De fet, van estar més a la piscina de l'hotel (a petició del xicotet Mateu) que a la platja.

Havia reservat una caravana pel cap de setmana!! Que content se n'anava a posar l'Albert. L'havia aconseguit de Manu, el nuvi de Teresa, que tenia una vella caravana i que llogava gent coneguda. L'Alba va intentar donar-li la sorpresa a l'Albert, però de camí a buscar la caravana se'l va treure hàbilment. El que desconeixia del tot era el destí... Montanejos.",

Encara que encara no feia temps de banyar-se Albert no desaprofitaria l'ocasió. El camí va ser tranquil, ja que no passava gairebé de 80km/h, mentre Mateu i Albert estaven darrere, ben lligats al cinturó, gaudien mirant per la finestra. Era un viatge molt especial.",

Les sorpreses no cessaven, i va ser quan es van adonar que el poble estava en festes! Hi havia un concert de Tessa (una rapera valenciana) al poliesportiu. El que seria un cap de setmana tranquil amb el petit Mateu ja es començava a torçar.",

Així d'alt i clar ho van escoltar aquests joves pares, encara que la realitat fos un babà o alguna cosa per l'estil, va ser un moment molt especial que mai oblidessin.
